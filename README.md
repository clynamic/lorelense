## Usage

Lorelense is deployed to the [clynamic.net](https://clynamic.net) domain.

In the current state of the project, lorelense is hard-coded to show
the projects of the first user in the database.

It is planned to expand this in the future.

## Build

Lorelense is written in Flutter.  
Because Flutter is exceptionally heavy for web, we are considering to rewrite
the project in React.

To build the project, install Flutter and run:

```bash
flutter build web
```

## Backend

For the backend, see [Scrollstack](https://github.com/clynamic/scrollstack).
